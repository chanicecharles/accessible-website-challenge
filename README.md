#accessible-website-challenge

This is the challenge for module 1.
During this challenge I change the title name and added alt text to important images.
I did attempt to add different titles such as <aside> to replace <div> but I didn't mange to get it to work with the css code even when I changed that. So I left the <div> tags for now.
  I deleted the footer as that was not in the client screen shot.
  Bellow is an screenshot of the website with devtools open to show some of the ALT code
